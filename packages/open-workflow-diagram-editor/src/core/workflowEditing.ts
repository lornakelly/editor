 *
 * Not supported:
 * - `/do/0/step1`

 * - object properties are traversed by property name
 * - task lists such as `do`, `try`, and `catch.do` are traversed by matching task name
 * - same-name sibling tasks are not allowed at the same level, so name-based lookup is sufficient

 * A `SwitchCase.then` field is **required** and typed as `FlowDirective` — it must either be a
 * reserved keyword (`continue`, `exit`, `end`) or a valid task name in the same scope.  When a
 * referenced task is deleted its name ceases to exist in the scope, leaving any pointing `then`
 * as a dangling reference that would make the workflow invalid.
 *
 * Because a switch case exists only to route execution to a target, removing its target makes
 * the whole case meaningless.  The safest automated recovery is therefore to drop the case
 * entirely.  Callers that need different semantics (e.g. reassigning the target) must do so
 * explicitly before calling `deleteTask`.
 *
 * The pruning is scope-local: only switch cases that live in sibling tasks of the deleted task
 * are affected.  Cases nested inside sub-tasks belong to a different scope and are left alone.

 * @param task - Sibling task whose inline switch cases may reference the deleted name.
